This unit is mainly composed of dark green colored hornblende amphibolite, kyanite-muscovite schist, actinolite schist and laminated blue grey limestone and chlorite schist. (unit 5-8). The grade of metamorphism increases from the north (greenschist facies) to the south (amphibolite facies) at the Minwun Range. The general strike is NW-SE, with dips (mostly 40-50) towards NE.

These metamorphics rocks are most possibly Mesozoic (esp. Triassic?) as they are lithologically and tectonically similar to schist of Tigyaing-Katha and Indaw area. Especially laminated blue grey limestone of present area is laterally traceable and very similar to Kywethe Chaung Limestone of Tigyaing-Katha area. In the latter area the precise chronostratigraphic position and field relation indicates that the Kywethe Chaung Limestone is post Permian or basal unit of the Mesozoic strata (Triassic).

In the past most towns disposed of their garbage in an open dump, generally little more than a hole in the ground where garbage was allowed to accumulate.Open dumps still exist in some rural areas. It creates the unpleasant smell and health hazard in this area. Sometime people dispose of solid waste by not disposing of it properly this informal, uncontrolied dumping waste is called non-disposal. 

Landfills 

Landfills are the most common approach to waste management.Landfill types rang from the old-fashioned open dump to modern landfills.Modern landfills are designed to confine the waste and prevent in from causing environment or health problems in nearby areas.
Modern landfills are built to compact the waste cover it with a compacted of soil(clay lying). It is called as sanitary landfill. The design of a salinity landfill is control of leachate migration. 

Leachate 

When the rain water percolate, through a pile of solid waste it picks up, soluable materials. The resulting contaminated water, called leach ate, represent on the most environmental problem in the design and maintenance of landfills. Depending on the composition of waste, the leach ate can be highly toxic. Heavy metals in leach ate from municipal landfill found arsenic,cadmium,lead, manganese, zinc and others. If leach ate is allowed to migrate out and come into contact with groundwater,surface water bodies, or any part of the biosphere it can cause environmental problems.

Sewage

Domestic and municipal sewage represents one of the most problems of liquid waste disposal. Household sewage is often managed with a septic tank in which solid components settle out and clear effluents are slowly released into the surrounding regolith. Municipal sewage treatment can include a number of processes. Primary treatment is the mechanical removal of solid wastes such as trash and fine sediment. Secondary treatment is a biologic process, in which bacteria degrade dissolved organics in the effluents. Tertiary treatment is a chemical proves that removes remaining contaminants, such as excess organic material, heavy metals and inorganic dissolved solids.
