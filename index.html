This unit is, mainly composed of dark green colored hornblende armphibolite, kyanite-muscovite schist, actinolite schist and laminated blue grey limestone and chlorite schist. (unit 5-8). The grade of metamorphism increases from the north (greenschist facies) to the south (amphibolite facies) at the Minwun Range. The general strike is NW-SE, with dips (mostly 40-50) towards NE.

These metamorphie rocks are most possibly Mesozoic (esp. Triassic?) as they are lithologically and tectonically similar to schist of Tigyaing-Katha and Indrw area. Especially laminated blue grey limestone of present area is laterally traceable and very similar to Kywethe Chaung Limestone of Tigyaing-Katha area. In the latter area the precise chronostratigraphic position and field relation indicates that the Kywethe Chaung Limestone is post Permian or basal unit of the Mesozoic strata (Triassic).
